###  I

<br>**I didn't do anything academic stuff in this semester and failed in comp2823 and data2901. I know it's kind of terrible but this may be the best situation I could made. I am extremely sensitive , fragile , cowardice and easily-give-up when facing difficulties. Can time heal everything? The answer is uncharted. Anyway, I should be on the road from now on.**
